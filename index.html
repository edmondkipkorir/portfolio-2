        <h2>My learning experience at Moringa school</h2>
        <p>Learning at Moringa has been a phenominal.<br
            It is here that i found practical meaning of exellence.i realized that exellence is an art won by training.
            At moringa,it is a sheer hardwork,commitment and team work.At Moringa i have learnt that discipline is a creadible vitue
            for a developer.Being a developer makes you think and source for ideas to solve any problem.
