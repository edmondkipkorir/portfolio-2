    <h2>My background</h2>
        <p>I studied my primary education at a school called St Peters.</p>
        <p>After completion of my primary education,i joined highschool and later joined campus.</p>
        <p>I enrolled for Information Science(IS) but did not complete for some reasons</p>
        <p>I have done some jobs unrelated to what i studied but have gained some basic skills which are helpful in the society</p>
        <p>The reason i decided to take a class on programming is because,it teaches a learner how to think</p>
        <p>Currently we depend on technology.Learning how to program helps to solve problems.</p>
